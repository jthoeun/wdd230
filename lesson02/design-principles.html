            <h3>Carmax</h3>

            <br>
            <p>Carmax's website shows a good use of visual hierachy. The way the site is designed, the designers know
                that most people would want to search for the car that they are looking to find. The search box is on
                the topof ther webpage. They have links on the bottom of the page for things that people would commonly
                use, There are 3 ways that someone can search for a car. The search bar, the search car button and the
                shop button on the bottom nav bar.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_5273.jpg" alt="'CFA mobile page">
            <h3>Chic-fil-a<h3>
                    <a href="https://www.chic-fil-a.com/"> https://www.chic-fil-a.com</a>
                    <br>
                    <p>The website for Chic-Fil-a shows a great exmaple of a clean design and use of white space. Thier
                        company color is red and white so they did not have to have many colors fullingh their site. The
                        use of no color helps make the brand's website more regionizable to everyone. The clean design
                        of the site also allows the focus to be on the picutre of the chicken sandwich and the 2 red
                        buttons for the order options.</p>

            <h2>Rules of Thirds</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_5274.jpg" alt="'best buy mobile page">
            <h3>Best Buy<h3>
                    <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com"> https://www.bestbuy.com</a>
                    <br>
                    <p>Best Buy's website show a great use of the rule of thirds. The first 3 items on the web page
                        shows things that the deisigner thinks people would want to go to. The top box would rotate
                        between several images that would tell the consumer what deals are happening on their site and
                        in stores. The smaller 2 boxes shows items that other people have views on the Best Buy site.
                        The site is super easy to navigate. I felt that they designed the site to hopefully get people
                        to hit the Deals box and then the most view items section.</p>
